# AI_AUTONOMOUS_DRIVING_PROJECT_KARTHIK_PADAMATA
The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive autonomous driving system that can perform semantic segmentation, object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition.

Outcomes:

• Understand and implement data preprocessing techniques for various computer vision tasks. 
• Develop and train deep learning models for semantic segmentation, object detection, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition. 
• Evaluate and improve the performance of these models using various metrics. 
• Prepare detailed documentation and presentation of their findings and results.
